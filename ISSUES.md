#### Fix float of tiles in urbit OS1
The tiles are currently split to left and right side. I want my tiles to all float left, just a preference.
I don't expect this to be merged into master, so maybe I should create this as a plugin instead.

#### Logging tile
This tile should show the urbit dojo log. When you're on mobile, you can't ssh into your e.g. digital ocean droplet, so would be useful if you could see your logs directly in your browser.

#### Use of `this.refs` is deprecated
File `~/urbit/pkg/interface/chat/src/js/components/lib/message.js` on line `19:5`.
